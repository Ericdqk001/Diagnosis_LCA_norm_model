# Diagnosis_LCA_norm_model

This is a MRes dissertation project at UCL. It applied latent class analysis, with an additional constraint on classification uncertainty, to isolate clinical cohorts of similar symptoms from the ABCD data. It then identified distinct cortical abnormalities to these cohorts using autoencoder-based normative models.
